# My Simple Theme

# Setup - Search 
For the search bar to work you need to create a static page called "search-results" in the Ghost dashboard and add the code that you got from google custom search.

# Setup - Contact Page
I use formspree for my contact form, go to formspree.io and follow the instructions, when you got the code create a static page called "contact" from the Ghost dashboard and add the code.
